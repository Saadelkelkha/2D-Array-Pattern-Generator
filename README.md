# 2D-Array-Pattern-Generator
This program allows users to input two numbers (within 0 to 10) to generate a dynamic 2D array pattern. It validates input, prompting re-entry for values outside the specified range. The resulting array is incrementally populated and displayed in its original order. For odd-numbered rows, the program showcases a modified element order.

This program enables users to input two numbers within the range of 0 to 10 and dynamically generates a 2D array pattern based on these inputs. It ensures valid input by prompting the user to re-enter values if they fall outside the specified range. The resulting 2D array is populated incrementally, and its elements are displayed in their original order. Additionally, the program presents a modified order for elements in odd-numbered rows, creating an interesting visual pattern.
