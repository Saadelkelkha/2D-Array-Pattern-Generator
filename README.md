# 2D-Array-Pattern-Generator
This program allows users to input two numbers (within 0 to 10) to generate a dynamic 2D array pattern. It validates input, prompting re-entry for values outside the specified range. The resulting array is incrementally populated and displayed in its original order. For odd-numbered rows, the program showcases a modified element order.
